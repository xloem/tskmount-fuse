TSKmount, is a free Fuse filesystem written in perl and based on The Sleuth Kit
tools. It is intended to provide an easy way to recover deleted files over ext2,
fat and ntfs filesystems.

Requirements:
	Perl-Fuse  <http://search.cpan.org/dist/Fuse/Fuse.pm>
	Fuse (filesystem in a userspace)  <http://fuse.sourceforge.net/>
	The Sleuth Kit	<http://www.sleuthkit.org/sleuthkit/>

Usage:
   Mounting device /dev/hda5 on /tmp/fuse empty directory:
	tskmount /dev/hda5 /tmp/fuse
   ### wait the "Ready" message before going to /tmp/fuse ###

   Unmounting filesystem:
	fusermount -u /tmp/fuse

   See common options:
	tskmount --help

Notes:
   Device or image file must be readable by the user, so you may have to do
"chmod o+r device" as root before if you intend to use tskmount with common
user rights. And don't forget to "chmod o-r device" after unmounting :-)

   Copying files is really slow and if size is more than 8 MB you shouldn't try
to copy the file directly. Instead use the "icat" sleuthkit command like
tskmount will show you in the alert message.

   Mounted filesystem is readonly.
