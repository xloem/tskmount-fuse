TSKmount is a Fuse filesystem written in perl and based on The Sleuth Kit
tools. It is intended to provide an easy way to recover deleted files over
ext2, fat and ntfs filesystems.

TSKmount runs on Linux, BSD and other Unix systems, see requirements below
for details.

TSKmount-Fuse is a free software; you can freely use, modify and redistribute
it under the terms of GNU GPL version 2 license.


Requirements:
	Perl-Fuse  <http://search.cpan.org/dist/Fuse/Fuse.pm>
	Fuse (filesystem in a userspace)  <http://fuse.sourceforge.net/>
	The Sleuth Kit	<http://www.sleuthkit.org/sleuthkit/>

	Debian packages: libfuse-perl, fuse-utils, libfuse2, sleuthkit


Usage:
   Mounting device /dev/hda5 on /tmp/fuse empty directory:
	tskmount /dev/hda5 /tmp/fuse
   ### wait the "Ready" message before going to /tmp/fuse ###

   Unmounting filesystem:
	fusermount -u /tmp/fuse

   See common options:
	tskmount --help


Notes:
 - Device or image file must be readable by the user, so you may have to do
"chmod o+r device" as root before if you intend to use tskmount with common
user rights. And don't forget to "chmod o-r device" after unmounting :-)

 - Copying files is really slow and if size is more than 8 MB you shouldn't
try to copy the file directly. Instead use the "icat" sleuthkit command like
tskmount will show you in the alert message.

 - Command line "find" should be used with -noleaf option to work properly.

 - Mounted filesystem is readonly.

 - Don't expect miracle, only a small part of the files can be recovered.
