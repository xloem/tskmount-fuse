tskmount - mounting the deleted files filesystem
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>
<B>tskmount</B> [ <B>-h</B> ] [ <B>-f</B> ] [ <B>-d</B> ] [ <B>-q</B> ] [ <B>-v</B> ] <B>filesystem</B> <B>mountpoint</B>
<P>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

<B>tskmount</B>(8) is the command to mount the deleted files filesystem.
<P>

<B>tskmount</B>(8) is part of the TSKmount-Fuse package, a Fuse filesystem written in Perl and based on The Sleuth Kit tools (commands <B>fls</B>, <B>icat</B> and <B>ils</B> are required).
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-h, --help</B><DD>
Print a help message.
<DT><B>-f, --full</B><DD>
Show all files in the mounted filesystem (deleted and not deleted). Mounting with this option may takes a long time and requires some memory during filesystem analysis at initialization.
<DT><B>-d, --deleted</B><DD>
Show only the deleted files. This is the default.
<DT><B>-q, --quiet</B><DD>
Do not print status messages, at initialization.
<DT><B>-v, --verbose</B><DD>
Print status messages at initialization. &quot;Ready&quot; is printed when filesystem has been computed entirely and is ready to be run. This is the default.
<DT><B>filesystem</B><DD>
The device (e.g /dev/sda1) or the file (any image filesystem) to mount. It must be readable with user rights.
<DT><B>mountpoint</B><DD>
This is an empty directory (e.g /tmp/fuse/) where to mount the filesystem.
</DL>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>

Here is some commands examples.
<H3>MOUNTING</H3>

<P>

Mounting device /dev/hda5 on /tmp/fuse empty directory:
<P>
<PRE>
                    tskmount /dev/hda5 /tmp/fuse
</PRE>

<P>

Wait the &quot;Ready&quot; message before going to the mountpoint /tmp/fuse.
<H3>UNMOUNTING</H3>

<P>

Unmounting the filesystem:
<P>
<PRE>
                    fusermount -u /tmp/fuse
</PRE>

<H3>A FULL EXAMPLE</H3>

<P>

Mounting device /dev/sda1 a USB pen device, to recover deleted file.
<P>
<PRE>
                    su -c &quot;chmod o+r /dev/sda1&quot;      # make readable
                    mkdir /tmp/fuse                  # create mountpoint
                    tskmount /dev/sda1 /tmp/fuse &amp;   # wait &quot;Ready&quot;
                    ls /tmp/fuse/                    # show content
                    cp /tmp/fuse/... .               # copy your file
                    fusermount -u /tmp/fuse          # unmount
                    su -c &quot;chmod o-r /dev/sda1&quot;      # reset permissions
</PRE>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

<P>

Device or image file must be readable by the user, so you may have to do a <B>chmod</B> like &quot;chmod o+r device&quot; as root before if you intend to use tskmount with common user rights. And don't forget to &quot;chmod o-r device&quot; after unmounting :-)
<P>

Copying files is really slow and if size is more than 8 MB you shouldn't try to copy the file directly. Instead use the <B>icat</B> sleuthkit command like tskmount will show you in the alert message.
<P>

Command line <B>find</B> should be used with -noleaf option to work properly.
<P>

Mounted filesystem is readonly.
<P>

Don't expect miracle, only a small part of the files can be recovered. Generaly the more recent.
